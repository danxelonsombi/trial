if we were to cherish the habitual impression that God can see and hear all that we do and say
and keeps a faithful record of our words and action, and we must meet it all, we would fear to sin.
Let the young ever remember that  wherever they are and whatever they do, they are in the presence of God.
No part part of our conduct escapes observation. We cannot hide our ways from the most high.

Psalms 42:11
There are those who have known the pardoning love of christ and who really desire to be children of the God, yet they realize that their character is imperfect, their life faulty, and they are ready to doubt whether their hearts have been renewed by the holy spirit. To such I would say, Do not draw back in despair. SC, 64.
