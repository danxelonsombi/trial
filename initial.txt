if we were to cherish the habitual impression that God can see and hear all that we do and say
and keeps a faithful record of our words and action, and we must meet it all, we would fear to sin.
Let the young ever remember that  wherever they are and whatever they do, they are in the presence of God.
No part part of our conduct escapes observation. We cannot hide our ways from the most high.
